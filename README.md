## Abstract
Continuously-growing data volumes lead to larger generic models. Specific use-cases are usually left out, since generic models tend to perform poorly in domain-specific cases. Our work addresses this gap with a method for selecting in-domain data from generic-domain (parallel text) corpora, for the task of machine translation. The proposed method ranks sentences in parallel general-domain data according to their cosine similarity with a monolingual domain-specific data set. We then select the top K sentences with the highest similarity score to train a new machine translation system tuned to the specific in-domain data. Our experimental results show that models trained on this in-domain data outperform models trained on generic or a mixture of generic and domain data. That is, our method selects high-quality domain-specific training instances at low computational cost and data size.

## Data Selection Tool
We also developed a Python tool that streamlines the process of selecting domain-specific data from generic corpora and training a domain-specific machine translation model. Our tool is particularly useful in scenarios where there is a dearth of domain-specific data or only monolingual data is available. Moreover, our tool is flexible and can handle varying sizes of domain-specific data.

## How to use
**Note:** we ported the best checkpoints of trained models to the Hugging Face (HF). Since our models were trained by [OpenNMT-py](https://github.com/OpenNMT/OpenNMT-py), it was not possible to employ them directly for inference on HF. To bypass this issue, we use [CTranslate2](https://github.com/OpenNMT/CTranslate2)– an inference engine for transformer models.

Follow steps below to translate your sentences:

1\. **Install the Python package**:
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install ctranslate2
```
2\. **Download models from our [HF repository](#Our-Pre-trained-models-on-Hugging-Face):**
You can do this manually or use the following python script:
```python
import requests

url = "Download Link"
model_path = "Model Path"
r = requests.get(url, allow_redirects=True)
open(model_path, 'wb').write(r.content)
```
3\. **Convert the downloaded model:**
```bash
ct2-opennmt-py-converter --model_path model_path --output_dir output_directory
```
4\. **Translate tokenized inputs:**

**Note:** the inputs should be tokenized by [SentencePiece](https://github.com/google/sentencepiece). 
You can also use tokenized version of [IWSLT test sets](https://github.com/JoyeBright/DataSelection-NMT/tree/main/Data-Table1/Dev%20and%20Test%20Sets).

```python
import ctranslate2
translator = ctranslate2.Translator("output_directory/")
translator.translate_batch([["▁H", "ello", "▁world", "!"]])
```
or
```python
import ctranslate2
translator = ctranslate2.Translator("output_directory/")
translator.translate_file(input_file, output_file, batch_type= "tokens/examples")
```
To customize the CTranslate2 functions, read this [API document](https://github.com/OpenNMT/CTranslate2/blob/master/docs/python.md).

5\. **Detokenize the outputs:**

**Note:** you need to [detokenize](https://github.com/JoyeBright/DataSelection-NMT/blob/main/Tools/detokenizer.perl) the output with the same sentencepiece model as used in step 4.

```bash
tools/detokenize.perl -no-escape -l fr \
< output_file \
> output_file.detok
```

6\. **Remove the @@ tokens:**
```bash
cat output_file.detok | sed -E 's/(@@)|(@@ )|(@@ ?$)//g' \
> output._file.detok.postprocessd
```
Use grep to check if @@ tokens removed successfully: 
```bash
grep @@ output._file.detok.postprocessd 
```
