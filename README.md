Selecting Parallel In-domain Sentences for Neural Machine Translation Using Monolingual Texts
# How to use
We ported the best checkpoints of trained models to the Hugging Face (HF) repository. <br>
Since our models were trained by [OpenNMT-py](https://github.com/OpenNMT/OpenNMT-py), it was not possible to employ them directly for inference on HF. <br>
To bypass this issue, we use [CTranslate2](https://github.com/OpenNMT/CTranslate2â€“ an inference engine for transformer models. <br>
1) First, you need to install the Python package.
`pip install --upgrade pip
pip install ctranslate2`
