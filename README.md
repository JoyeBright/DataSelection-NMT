Selecting Parallel In-domain Sentences for Neural Machine Translation Using Monolingual Texts
# How to use
We ported the best checkpoints of trained models to the Hugging Face (HF) repository. <br>
Since they were trained with OpenNMT-py, it was not possible to employ them directly for inference on HF. <br>
To bypass this, you can use [CTranslate2](https://github.com/OpenNMT/CTranslate2)
