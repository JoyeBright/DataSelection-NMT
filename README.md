## How to use
**Note:** we ported the best checkpoints of trained models to the Hugging Face (HF). Since our models were trained by [OpenNMT-py](https://github.com/OpenNMT/OpenNMT-py), it was not possible to employ them directly for inference on HF. To bypass this issue, we use [CTranslate2](https://github.com/OpenNMT/CTranslate2)â€“ an inference engine for transformer models.

Follow steps below to translate your sentences:

1\. **Install the Python package**:
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install ctranslate2
```
2\. **Download models from our [HF repository](# Our):**
